### What I learned 📚

In this first challenge of the junior class I focus on cosolidar the knowledge acquired in previous challenges

### Continued development 🔨

In the following challenges I would like to consolidate my javascript management, which remains my weakest point when it comes to giving dynamism and functionality to my designs.

### Useful resources 📂
